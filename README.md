Rotary Engine Design - SolidWorks Project

Project Overview
This repository contains the complete 3D CAD design of a rotary (Wankel) engine modeled in SolidWorks. The design includes all major components of a functional rotary engine with proper clearances and motion analysis.

Design Features
Complete rotary engine assembly with rotor, housing, eccentric shaft, and seals

Properly modeled apex seals and side seals

Motion study demonstrating the 4-stroke cycle
Detailed technical drawings for manufacturing
Parametric design allowing for size modifications

Software Requirements

SolidWorks 2018 or later (recommended 2020+ for all features)
Simulation add-in (for stress analysis)
Motion study module (for animation)
